### 1. **Main Ideas and Initial Concepts**
   - The core idea is to build a MIDI merge device that merges MIDI data from two inputs and outputs through multiple channels. This device also manages a clock signal, providing precise timing and synchronization to connected MIDI equipment.
   - Key features include:
     - **Master Clock Selection**: An SPDT switch allows for selecting the master MIDI clock source.
     - **Analog Clock Output**: Synchronized with the MIDI clock for external device control.
     - **Adjustable Clock Pulse Resolution**: Allows for user control over the clock pulse-per-quarter note (PPQN).
     - **OLED Display**: Displays BPM, clock rate, and other useful information.
   - The **Arduino MEGA 2560 Pro** is used as the primary microcontroller for its multiple I/O pins and capability to handle complex MIDI merging tasks.

### 2. **MIDI Circuitry and Clock Management**
   - **MIDI Input Circuit**: The design incorporates optocouplers (6N137) for proper isolation, ensuring safe handling of incoming MIDI signals without electrical interference.
   - **MIDI Thru and Output Circuits**: Designed to accurately route MIDI signals from the Arduino to multiple MIDI outputs while ensuring protection through the use of resistors and diodes.
   - **Clock Signal Shaping**: Implemented using the 74HC14 Schmitt Trigger IC to clean up the clock pulses, thereby eliminating noise and providing a stable MIDI clock output.

### 3. **Design Considerations for Protection and Filtering**
   - **Surge and Reverse Polarity Protection**: 1N5819 Schottky diodes were added to protect the power inputs and MIDI signal lines from voltage surges and reverse polarity.
   - **Filtering Capacitors**: Various capacitors were incorporated in critical areas of the circuit:
     - **Clock Output Filtering**: Added to stabilize the clock signal for connected MIDI devices.
     - **Power Line Filtering**: Used to reduce noise and maintain stability near sensitive components like optocouplers.
   - **Pull-Up and Pull-Down Resistors**: Selected to maintain correct voltage levels for signal detection and to stabilize the digital lines.

### 4. **Code and Software Development**
   - **Clock Signal Generation**: Initially, PWM was considered for generating the clock pulses; however, it was recognized that using **Timer1** would provide more precise and consistent timing, addressing the inaccuracies inherent in PWM.
   - **MIDI Input Handling**: The code was structured to receive MIDI messages in **MIDI_CHANNEL_OMNI** mode, allowing the device to respond to any channel.
   - **Set Handle Message Method**: A method was included for handling incoming MIDI messages effectively. We also discussed the possibility of detaching or optimizing this function to improve code modularity.

### 5. **Recent Improvements and Iterations**
   - **Clock Output Circuit Update**: Recently, capacitors (C14, C15) were added to the clock output stage for further noise filtering, ensuring that the clock output is stable and clean.
   - **Component Value Review**: Detailed reviews of resistor and capacitor values were conducted, focusing on ensuring that timing and pulse characteristics meet the requirements of the MIDI specification.
   - **Decoupling Capacitors**: It was suggested to add decoupling capacitors near the 74HC14 IC to minimize the impact of power line noise, which could interfere with pulse stability.

### 6. **Project Progress and Future Considerations**
   - **Progress Overview**:
     - The hardware components, including input and output circuits, power protection, clock signal conditioning, and user interface, have been prototyped and tested.
     - Software functionality for merging MIDI inputs, controlling clock output, and handling MIDI messages is well underway, with a focus on improving timing precision.
   - **Upcoming Improvements**:
     - Implementing **Timer1** for clock generation to replace PWM and improve clock signal accuracy.
     - Testing the RC filter networks to ensure no unintended delays or signal issues affect the precision of the MIDI clock output.
     - Modularizing the code for better readability and maintenance, potentially splitting the MIDI handling, clock generation, and display functions into separate, reusable modules.

Overall, the project has transformed from an initial concept into a sophisticated MIDI merging and clock management device. The integration of effective isolation, filtering, and protection measures—along with clean clock signal generation—has ensured reliable operation and precise MIDI timing. Moving forward, the focus will be on refining timing accuracy, enhancing modularity in the code, and finalizing the design for stability and usability in practical scenarios.
