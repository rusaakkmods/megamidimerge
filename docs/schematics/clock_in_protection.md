### Clock In Surge Protection Improvement

To add safety measures for the **Clock In (J10)** circuit to protect against high currents and voltage spikes, we have made the following improvements:

#### **Components and Their Values**:
- **J10 (Clock In Jack)**: The input jack for external clock signals.
- **R18**: **220立 current limiting resistor** in series.
- **D1 (1N5819 Schottky Diode)**: To clamp any overvoltage to **GND**.
- **D2 (1N5819 Schottky Diode)**: To clamp any overvoltage to **5V**.
- **F1**: **50mA polyfuse** for overcurrent protection.

#### **Detailed Schematic Pinout Routing**:

1. **Clock In Jack (J10)**:
   - **Pin T (Tip)** of **J10**:
     - **Connect to R18** (220立 current limiting resistor).
   - **Pin S (Sleeve)** of **J10**:
     - **Connect to GND**.
   - **Pin TN (if present, not used for routing)**.

2. **Current Limiting Resistor (R18 - 220立)**:
   - **One end connected to Pin T** of **J10**.
   - **The other end connected to MEGA PIN 3**.
   - This resistor limits the current flowing into **MEGA PIN 3**.

3. **Polyfuse (F1 - 50mA)**:
   - **Connect F1 in series** with **R18** between **Pin T** and **MEGA PIN 3**.
   - This provides protection against sustained overcurrent.

4. **Schottky Diodes (D1 and D2 - 1N5819)**:
   - **D1**: Voltage Clamping to **GND**:
     - **Anode** of **D1** connected to **GND**.
     - **Cathode** of **D1** connected to the node where **R18** and **F1** connect to **MEGA PIN 3**.
     - This clamps any negative voltage spikes to protect **MEGA PIN 3**.
   - **D2**: Voltage Clamping to **+5V**:
     - **Anode** of **D2** connected to the node where **R18** and **F1** connect to **MEGA PIN 3**.
     - **Cathode** of **D2** connected to **+5V**.
     - This clamps any voltage above **5V** to the **5V rail**, protecting **MEGA PIN 3** from overvoltage.

5. **MEGA PIN 3**:
   - The connection from **R18** (after going through the **polyfuse**) connects to **MEGA PIN 3** for **clock pulse detection**.
   - **MEGA PIN 3** should also be configured as an **input** with either an internal or external **pull-up resistor** to maintain a stable state when no signal is connected.

#### **Explanation**:
- **R18 (220立)**: Limits the current from **pin T** of **J10** to **MEGA PIN 3**, ensuring the current remains within safe limits.
- **F1 (50mA Polyfuse)**: Provides overcurrent protection and disconnects the circuit if a sustained overcurrent condition occurs.
- **D1 (1N5819)**: Protects **MEGA PIN 3** from any **negative voltage spikes** by clamping to **GND**.
- **D2 (1N5819)**: Protects **MEGA PIN 3** from **positive overvoltage** spikes above **5V** by clamping to the **5V rail**.

#### **Summary**:
- The **current limiting resistor (R18)** and **polyfuse (F1)** together ensure that **MEGA PIN 3** is protected against high current conditions.
- The **Schottky diodes (D1 and D2)** provide protection against overvoltage and negative voltage spikes, clamping the signal to a safe range.
- This setup adds robustness to the **Clock In** circuitry and helps to prevent damage to the microcontroller.
