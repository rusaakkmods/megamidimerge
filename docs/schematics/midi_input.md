### MIDI Input Schematics Review



#### **Review of the Changes**:

1. **Pull-Up Resistor Update**:

   - You’ve replaced **R4** with a **4.7kΩ** resistor connected to **5V**, consistent with **R2**. This is the ideal configuration for compatibility with the **Arduino MEGA** logic levels. It ensures both MIDI inputs have robust and reliable pull-up to 5V.

2. **Capacitor Placement and Values**:

   - The **10pF capacitors (C1, C3)** are placed across the optocoupler's anode and cathode, providing high-frequency noise suppression. This positioning will help to eliminate noise before the signal reaches the **6N137** optocoupler, improving the stability of the input signal.
   - The **decoupling capacitors (C2, C4)** are still correctly placed between **5V and GND** to filter noise from the power supply, helping to ensure stable operation of the optocouplers.

3. **General Layout**:

   - The **diode network** and **optocoupler** placement are clear and follow good design practices.
   - **Schottky diodes (D2, D4)** and **Zener diodes (D1, D3)** are effectively used to provide robust protection for both MIDI input lines. The combination ensures that both overvoltage and reverse current are managed properly.

#### **Final Suggestions**:

- **PCB Layout Considerations**:

  - When routing the PCB, try to place the **decoupling capacitors (C2, C4)** as close to the **Vcc and GND pins** of each **6N137** optocoupler as possible. This will maximize their effectiveness.
  - Ensure that there is a solid **ground plane** under the MIDI input section. This will help in reducing noise and provide better **EMI shielding**.

- **Power Supply Lines**:

  - Keep the **power supply lines** to the optocouplers and the **5V pull-up resistors** as short as possible. This will reduce any noise pick-up from these lines.

- **Test the Filtering Capacitor**:

  - The **10pF capacitor** should ideally reduce high-frequency noise without affecting the MIDI signal. However, in case of unexpected behavior (such as missing MIDI messages), you might experiment with the capacitor value between **10pF to 22pF** to find the most optimal noise suppression for your environment.

#### **Summary**:

Schematic is well-optimized for handling MIDI inputs with proper noise suppression and signal integrity. The changes made—updating pull-up resistors to 4.7kΩ tied to 5V, adding small capacitors for filtering, and ensuring consistent protection with Zener and Schottky diodes—result in a solid design.
