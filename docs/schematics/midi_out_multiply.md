### Multiply MIDI Output Schematic Design

#### **Design Overview**

To multiply the output of **Serial3** from the Arduino into **4 MIDI Outputs**, the following design uses a **6N137 optocoupler** to isolate the original signal and a **74HC14** buffer IC to distribute the isolated signal to four MIDI outputs. This ensures strong signal integrity and electrical isolation.

#### **Components Needed**

- **6N137 Optocoupler**: For isolating the Serial3 signal.
- **Logic Buffer IC (74HC14)**: For distributing the isolated MIDI signal to four outputs.
- **Current-Limiting Resistors (220Ω)**: On each MIDI output line to adhere to the MIDI standard.
- **Pull-Up Resistor (4.7kΩ)**: For the output of the 6N137 to ensure proper logic levels.
- **Schottky Diodes (1N5819)**: For protection on each MIDI output line.
- **Decoupling Capacitors (0.1µF)**: To filter out noise on the power supply lines.
- **TRS Jacks**: For MIDI OUT 3 and MIDI OUT 4.

#### **Step-by-Step Schematic Description**

1. **Input from Serial3 TX**:

   - Connect the **TX pin from Serial3** to the **anode** of the LED in the **6N137 optocoupler** through a **220Ω current-limiting resistor**.
   - The **cathode** of the LED should be connected to **ground**.

2. **6N137 Optocoupler**:

   - **Pin 2 (Anode)**: Connect to **TX Serial3** via a **220Ω resistor**.
   - **Pin 3 (Cathode)**: Connect to **GND**.
   - **Pin 8 (Vcc)**: Connect to **+5V** with a **0.1µF capacitor** placed nearby for decoupling.
   - **Pin 5 (Output)**: This is the optically isolated output. Connect a **4.7kΩ pull-up resistor** from **pin 5** to **+5V**.
   - **Pin 6 (Enable)**: Tie to **GND** to enable the output of the optocoupler.

3. **Buffered Fan-Out Stage: Complete Pinout Using 74HC14**

   - Use a **74HC14** (Schmitt Trigger Inverter) to fan out the isolated MIDI signal to the four MIDI outputs.
   - **Input to Buffer IC**: Connect the output from the **6N137 (Pin 5)** to **Pin 1 (Input A)** of the **74HC14**.
   - **Output Pins of Buffer IC**: Use the following output pins to connect to the MIDI Outputs:
     - **Pin 2** (Output of Inverter A) to **MIDI OUT 1**.
     - **Pin 4** (Output of Inverter B) to **MIDI OUT 2**.
     - **Pin 6** (Output of Inverter C) to **MIDI OUT 3**.
     - **Pin 8** (Output of Inverter D) to **MIDI OUT 4**.
   - **Input Pins for Remaining Inverters**:
     - Tie the unused **input pins (3, 5, 9, 11, 13)** of the **74HC14** to **GND** to prevent floating inputs and potential noise issues.

4. **MIDI Output Connections** (for each of the 4 MIDI Outputs: Detailed Pinout):

   - **MIDI OUT 1 and MIDI OUT 2 (DIN Jacks)**:
     - **Pin 4 of MIDI Jack**:
       - Connect the output from the buffer IC through a **220Ω resistor**.
       - For example, connect **Pin 2** of the **74HC14** to **Pin 4** of **MIDI OUT 1** through a **220Ω resistor**.
     - **Pin 5 of MIDI Jack**:
       - Connect to **GND**.
     - **Pin 2 of MIDI Jack** (Shield Connection):
       - Connect to **GND** to provide shielding and reduce noise.
     - **Protection Diode**:
       - Add a **Schottky diode (1N5819)** between **Pin 4** (output) and **GND** with the cathode connected to **Pin 4** to provide reverse current protection.

   - **MIDI OUT 3 and MIDI OUT 4 (TRS Jacks)**:
     - **Tip (T)**: Connect the output from the buffer IC through a **220Ω resistor**.
       - For **MIDI OUT 3**, connect **Pin 6** of the **74HC14** to **Tip** through a **220Ω resistor**.
       - For **MIDI OUT 4**, connect **Pin 8** of the **74HC14** to **Tip** through a **220Ω resistor**.
     - **Ring (R)**: Connect to **GND**.
     - **Sleeve (S)**: Connect to **GND** (shield connection).
     - **Protection Diode**:
       - Add a **Schottky diode (1N5819)** between **Tip** (output) and **GND** with the cathode connected to **Tip** to provide reverse current protection.

5. **Power Supply and Decoupling**:

   - Connect **+5V** and **GND** to the **74HC14** IC.
   - Place a **0.1µF decoupling capacitor** close to the power supply pins of the IC to filter out high-frequency noise.

#### **Summary of Connections**

- The **TX from Serial3** is connected to the **LED side** of the **6N137 optocoupler** through a **220Ω resistor**.
- The **output side of the 6N137** provides an isolated signal that is pulled up to **+5V** with a **4.7kΩ resistor**.
- The isolated signal is then **buffered** using a **74HC14**, which fans out the signal to the four separate MIDI outputs.
- **MIDI OUT 1 and 2** use **DIN jacks**, while **MIDI OUT 3 and 4** use **TRS jacks** for compatibility with devices that use TRS MIDI connections.
- Each **MIDI output** is connected through a **220Ω resistor**, and **Schottky diodes** are used for protection.

#### **Benefits of This Design**

- **Isolation**: The use of the **6N137** ensures that the Arduino MEGA is electrically isolated from the MIDI outputs, protecting it from any harmful electrical spikes.
- **Signal Integrity**: The **buffer IC** provides strong signal drive capability, ensuring all four MIDI outputs have consistent signal levels without degradation.
- **Protection**: **Schottky diodes** and **current-limiting resistors** safeguard the output against overcurrent and reverse polarity.

This design will provide a reliable way to multiply the **Serial3** output into four MIDI outputs while maintaining signal integrity and protecting both the Arduino and connected MIDI devices.
