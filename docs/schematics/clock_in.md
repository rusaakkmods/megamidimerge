### Review of Updated Clock In Schematic

This updated schematic looks well-optimized and includes all the important elements for both input protection and reliable plug detection. Here’s a review:

#### **Jack (J10 - Clock In)**:
- The **Tip (T)** is correctly connected to **MEGA PIN 3** through **R18**.
- **Sleeve (S)** is connected to **GND** for proper grounding, and **TN** is also connected to **T** when unplugged, which allows for plug detection functionality.
  
#### **Current Limiting Resistor (R18 - 220Ω)**:
- The addition of **R18 (220Ω)** in series between **pin T** of **J10** and **MEGA PIN 3** is an excellent addition for protecting **MEGA PIN 3** from any excessive current.
- This provides the necessary safety without affecting the functionality of clock pulse detection.

#### **Voltage Divider for Plug Detection (R16, R17)**:
- **R17 (10kΩ)** and **R16 (10kΩ)** form a voltage divider providing a stable reference voltage for **MEGA PIN A1**.
- This is sufficient to differentiate between the plug being connected and disconnected, allowing the microcontroller to detect the plug status reliably.

#### **Noise Filtering Capacitor (C12 - 0.1µF)**:
- **C12 (0.1µF)** is placed correctly between the voltage divider and **GND**, helping to eliminate high-frequency noise and ensuring stable readings on **MEGA PIN A1**.

### **Suggestions**:
- The current configuration now provides the necessary safety (via **R18**) and a stable voltage reference for plug detection.
- Ensure the voltage at **MEGA PIN A1** is well-tested to confirm it provides consistent readings under both conditions (plug connected vs. disconnected). The **10kΩ** resistors should work well, but testing might indicate if a slight adjustment is needed.

### **Summary**:
- The addition of **R18 (220Ω)** makes this schematic well-protected.
- The plug detection functionality is intact, with **R16**, **R17**, and **C12** providing stable operation.
- This circuit now effectively protects the microcontroller inputs and reliably differentiates between plug states.

This design should be ready for implementation. Great work! If you need further assistance or modifications, feel free to ask!
