### MIDI Thru Schematics Review

#### **Review of the MIDI Thru Schematics**:

1. **Current Configuration**:
   - The **MIDI Thru circuits (J3, J4)** are well-configured to pass through the MIDI signal from the inputs (TX Serial1 and TX Serial2) directly to the MIDI Thru ports.
   - The **220Ω resistors (R5, R6)** are correctly used to limit the current on the MIDI lines. This is in accordance with the MIDI specification to ensure reliable signal transmission while avoiding excessive current draw.

2. **Diode Protection**:
   - **Schottky diodes (D5, D6)** are used to protect the output lines. These diodes clamp any reverse voltage or spikes, thereby protecting the output stage from potential damage. This is good practice for ensuring that unexpected signals do not cause harm.

3. **Power Supply Considerations**:
   - The **5V power supply** is routed through the **220Ω resistors** to the MIDI Thru output pins, which ensures proper signal levels while limiting current as per the MIDI standards.

#### **Suggestions for Improvement**:

1. **Capacitor Addition**:
   - Adding a small **capacitor (10pF to 22pF)** across the output lines could help filter out any high-frequency noise. This will be particularly useful if there is a significant amount of electromagnetic interference (EMI) in the environment, thereby ensuring cleaner output signals.

2. **PCB Layout**:
   - Keep the **ground connections** short and direct to minimize noise. A solid **ground plane** under the MIDI Thru section would be beneficial to further minimize EMI and ensure signal stability.

#### **Summary**:

The MIDI Thru schematics are solid, with a good balance of signal integrity and protection. The use of **Schottky diodes** and **current-limiting resistors** aligns well with industry practices for MIDI circuits. Adding small filtering capacitors across the output lines could further improve noise suppression and overall stability.
