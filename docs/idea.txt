Main ideas:

1. Core Function: Merges MIDI data from two MIDI inputs and sends it to MIDI 1 output.
2. Master Clock Selection: An SPDT switch allows you to choose which MIDI input provides the master clock.
3. Analog Clock Output: Generates an analog clock signal synchronized with the MIDI clock.
4. Clock Pulse Rate: A knob to control through different clock pulse per quarter note (1 to 24 ppqn) for the analog clock output.
5. Active Master Input Display: Shows the active MIDI Input that act as Master Clock on an OLED display.
6. BPM Display: Displays the Beats Per Minute (BPM) in 4/4 time signature based on selected master clock. 
7. PPQN Display: Pulse Per Quarter Note (PPQ) based on setting selected.
8. Analog Clock Input: Override MIDI master clock.

Features:
1. Using Arduino MEGA 2560 Pro
2. 2 MIDI Input (as Input 1 and Input 2)
3. 2 MIDI Thru (from MIDI input 1 and MIDI Input 2)
4. a MIDI Output (Merged from both MIDI Input)
3. a 3.5mm TRS Socket as a second MIDI Output (independent copy of the first MIDI Output)
5. an Analog Clock Out based on Master clock
6. an Analog Clock In that should override the MIDI Clock when plugged
7. a Master Clock switch between Input 1 or Input 2
8. a Knob to control Clock out ppqn.
9. USB should power the system and should be recognized by Computer as MIDI Device transmitting merged MIDI Output
10. an OLED Display to view Active Master information
